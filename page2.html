</center>


<center>
<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5"> Designed a box using the video provided in the powerpoint slides with the living hinge. Edited the design a little so that it will have tabs to be able to connect around the box and edited the front of the design to separate it into two different plates. 

Designs were supposed to follow an ocean theme, decided with a moon/sun/star theme instead. Also added slots to the side of the design to allow it to be able to insert a middle partition. This is so that there will be two different spots for the drawers and the top layer.

I had also faced issues regarding the kerf and exporting of file. While trying to export the file, I was using illustrator instead, they had the scaling option and i did not adjust it to 1:1 scale which caused my file to be extremely small. And i was wondering why it was so small when i exported it to corelDraw on the laser cutter desktop. 

After a few trial and errors, I managed to finish my jewellery box.
