</center>


<center>
<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5"> Designed a box using the video provided in the powerpoint slides with the living hinge. Edited the design a little so that it will have tabs to be able to connect around the box and edited the front of the design to separate it into two different plates. 

Designs were supposed to follow an ocean theme, decided with a moon/sun/star theme instead. Also added slots to the side of the design to allow it to be able to insert a middle partition. This is so that there will be two different spots for the drawers and the top layer.

I had also faced issues regarding the kerf and exporting of file. While trying to export the file, I was using illustrator instead, they had the scaling option and i did not adjust it to 1:1 scale which caused my file to be extremely small. And i was wondering why it was so small when i exported it to corelDraw on the laser cutter desktop. 

After a few trial and errors, I managed to finish my jewellery box.

<h1 style="color:#fd6013">Assignment 2: 3D Printing</h1>
</center>


<center>
<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5"> For the 3D printing, I decided to make a simple phone stand using a common triangular stand design. I then created a new sketch layer to sketch and mirror the cat face and ears onto the phone stand. 

After this I also did some post processing to make sure my phone stand has a sleek finish. 

I then printed a backup piece which was smaller, this turned out to be a little bit of a failure as because the ears did not have supports, it started sloping downwards. And due to the low infill and lightning line type, it was quite flimsy and was unable to withstand the weight of my phone. So I kept it home instead. 

So far I forgot to take a photo of the one I had submitted, but I have embedded the model below.

<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5"> Task 1 
Blink using red LED

Wired a red LED to pin 6, with a 220 ohm resistor. Had it blink for 500 miliseconds and then turn off for 200 miliseconds. 

Task 2 
Blink using 3 LED (Red, Green, Blue)

Wired red, green and blue led to pin 6, 7, 8 respectively. Used 220 ohm resistor for each. Had each led turn on for 1000 miliseconds and turn off for 100 miliseconds. Using the same line of code changing the pin number to each respective colours. 

Task 3 
Toggling red LED ON/OFF using pushbutton 

Wired red LED to pin 6, pushbutton to pin 5. Each used 220 ohm resistor. The code will check the status of the button, if buttonCheck is false, the LED is turned on and sets the buttonCheck to 'true'. If the button is still pressed and buttonCheck is true, it turns off the LED and sets the buttonCheck to false and waits for the button to be released. 


Task 4
Toggling between 3 LED (Red, Green, Blue) using pushbutton 

Wired red, green, blue LEDs to pin 4,5 and 6 respectively. Switch connected to pin 7. Each used 220 ohm resistor. Code uses debounce function to prevent bouncing issues when switch is pressed. When the switch is pressed, based on the count variable, it will switch between the different LED patterns based on the number of times the button is pressed.
