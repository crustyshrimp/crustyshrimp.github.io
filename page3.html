<h1 style="color:#fd6013">Exercise 3: Sketch</h1>
</center>

<center>
<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5">
<br>
During this sketch started with a main rectangular body, filleting the top and setting the length of the fillet to half the width of the rectangle. This ensures that the side will be a perfect quadrant, repeat with the other side to get a semi circle. 
</br>
<br>
I made a guideline to the midpoint of the semicircle. This was where the circle would be positioned at. After that i made a guide line for the rectangle, from the bottom and sides to position it correctly. Then made the rectangle and then i finished the sketch.

<h1 style="color:#fd6013">Exercise 4: Spanner </h1>
</center>

<center>
<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5">
<br>
First started off with the rectangle body with given dimensions, after that started with the circles at the sides of the spanner. I then used the trim tool to trim any of the overlapping and unwanted lines. After that I then fillet the edges of the spanner so it will produce a rounded edge. After that using the polygon tool, I created a hexagon and pentagon for the circular part of the spanner. 
</br>
<br>
Then I made a rectangular part in the middle and filleted all the ends so that it becomes a semicircle shape.

<h1 style="color:#fd6013">Exercise 5: Lego piece </h1>
</center>

<center>
<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5">
<br>
Started off with the rectangle body of the lego piece. After that the 6 studs on the lego, using guidelines from the design shown in the slides. 
</br>
<br>
I first extruded the studs, I measured the length by the height of the studs in addition to the height of the body. 
</br>
<br>
I then extruded the the body up, and then shelled the bottom.

<h1 style="color:#fd6013">Exercise 6: Name Tag </h1>
</center>

<center>
<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5">
<br>
Firstly made a rectangle and filleted the sides using the quarter fillet method mentioned in previous CAD exercises, then made a smaller rectangle inside to create a rim.
</br>
<br>
After that, made a circle by making the midpoint the intersection of the fillet side, and then make another circle to make the rim.
</br>
<br>
Then used the text tool to make a design and extruded everthing.

<h1 style="color:#fd6013">Exercise 7: Cube Shell</h1>
</center>

<center>
<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5">
<br>
I first sketched out each cube, and then extrude them respectively based on its layers.
</br>
<br>
After all the cubes have been extruded, I shelled it.

<h1 style="color:#fd6013">Exercise 8: Mug</h1>
</center>

<center>
<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5">
<br>
Firstly sketched out a circle, and then a smaller circle inside, the rim of the circle will act as the mug's body. After that I extruded the large circle to create the base and the extruded the rim to create the body.
</br>
<br>
I then sketched perpendicular to the initial mug sketch and created a handle using the arc and line tools. I then extruded it and joined it to the main mug body.

<h1 style="color:#fd6013">Exercise 11: Chess piece </h1>
</center>

<center>
<p style="color:#fd6013"><font size="5">
<br>
I got a vector image from google of various chess piece heads. I then pasted the image into fusion and created a sketch layer above it. I traced the design of the queen piece and then extruded it, this acted as the head for my chess piece
</br>
<br>
I drew half of the body and the axis line as I was going to revolve it. After that I went into the body section of fusion and used the revolve tool. 
</br>
<br>
I then joined the queen head to the top of the body
</br>
<br>
I then got into issues while shelling the body, I think my body design might have been to small and complex to be shelled. And while I tried many times to re-do it it still gave me the same issue. So I just left it as is. 
</br>
<br>
For the 3D printing portion I printed out the chess piece which I also forgot to take a picture of. Here is the embedded model.
